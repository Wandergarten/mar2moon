short-term price doesn't matter we're talking about the greatest wealth transfer in history we're literally watching everyone from individuals to corporations to financial institutions to now countries decide that they want a transparent programmatic certain monetary policy it flies in the face of the existing system we don't know what the next thing that's going to happen in the existing system is and therefore that uncertainty leads to fear and so what ultimately happens is that you are seeing people around the world over 100 million individuals now all the way up to countries say we need something that has certainty in the monetary policy and when you have a fixed supply asset and there is ever increasing demand and over long periods of time more and more people companies corporations uh financial institutions and countries come in and start to adopt it the us dollar price has to go up to accommodate everyone it's the only thing that can happen if you believe in supply and demand economics all right welcome back everybody to altcoin daily my name's austin that was of course anthony pompliano rallying the troops in times of uncertainty that bitcoin is here to stay you see day-to-day short-term price action does not matter if you understand the macro picture of what's happening here innovation with cryptocurrency is the biggest opportunity biggest wealth transfer of a lifetime bigger than the california gold rush which was regionally based bigger than the dot-com craze of 99 which was primarily siloed off to u.s accredited investors only cryptocurrency on the other hand is global and innovation is happening that's my opinion i'm not a registered financial advisor only my opinion but in today's video i want to update you with the innovation happening in cryptos today check the timestamps down below in the video description and like always let's start with bitcoin twitter ceo jack dorsey says it's only a matter of time before twitter integrates the bitcoin lightning network which would obviously be huge we know the lightning network is a second layer solution used to scale bitcoin and people are speculating that if integrated with twitter we could have bitcoin micropayments on one of the top social media platforms in existence now to keep things real this is not happening anytime soon but according to jack it is happening somebody commented to him on twitter will we ever be able to stream sats basically build the lightning network into bluesky or twitter please and thank you jack responded only a matter of time i like it very cool and by the way just to clarify whether this happens or not because he you know this is far from a promise he's just talking on twitter it's just nice to have one of the smartest most respected tech minds you know who cares about his politics but just tech minds it's nice to have them team bitcoin i like it i'm following okay next piece of major news a little partnership between polygon and 0x polygon is committing over 10 million dollars to reach 1 million new users using the 0x api so these are two cryptocurrencies partnering up 0x is a sort of decentralized exchange protocol polygon a layer two scaling solution for eth and the growth continues in a direct quote from the ceo of polygon we're thrilled to work on the goal of bringing 1 million users to polygon with 0x the polygon defi for all fund will aim to further support developers and projects and build a robust and secure defi infrastructure with a 7 million commitment to the 0x dow and what i like about this is essentially this is a win-win it brings new users to polygon new users to 0x and the growth of both ecosystems continue the network that is onboarding a large number of decentralized applications i'm assuming this is referring to polygon aims to hit 1 million users through 0x's decentralized exchange liquidity aggregator api okay i get it they're both sort of opening up their ecosystems to each other in a sense and to get specific last month 0x released a polygon version api for its decentralized exchange liquidity aggregator opening up the 0x api tool to the expanding polygon market the api allows major ethereum based dax liquidity channels including the channels most of us have heard of integrate directly to polygon big big news if you hold matic if you hold 0x give me a huzzah down below in the comments we'll see how this plays out i'll keep tabs on this okay next piece of major news for ripple and xrp ripple proposes a massive xrp ledger upgrade to support defi and smart contract capabilities interesting they want to be a smart contract platform in a sense just like ethereum like cardano the company says this could unleash decentralized finance defi and smart contracts across the broader xrp ecosystem without decreasing the xrp ledger's efficiency now that's a big change exactly how would this be done well the ripple plans to accomplish this through the use of federated side chains according to david schwartz the company's chief technology officer the side chains would be connected to the xrp ledger by federators which are pieces of software run by parties who operate validators on at least one side chain so this is not the main chain but side chains and the side chains would operate like their own blockchains but xrp and issue tokens can move between them and the xrp ledger interesting it would be interesting to see which dapps would prefer to be built and launch off xrp as opposed to the many smart contract competitors but it's not all suns and roses right it there is risks because this is a big change in a direct quote making these changes is probably the biggest part of this effort because even though they won't be enabled on the main xrp ledger there is still risk associated with changing the software for example some existing code may need to be moved or adjusted which carries the risk of inadvertently changing behavior so some code would need to be adjusted and if this were to get in a spot where it would be voted on any potential xrpl amendments require an approval rating from the ledger's validators and if an amendment stays above that threshold for two weeks it is activated so we'll see give me your thoughts on xrp down below i'll keep searching as i get more info i'll keep you updated next piece of news for altcoin algo arrington capital launches a 100 million dollar algorand ecosystem fund so this is a huge sign of support al grand arlington capital is run by the tech crunch founder and this is actually the tech crunch founder's second crypto fund last year he made a big bet on the xrp ecosystem he says he's not abandoning that but now he's focused on algorand this is michael arrington's crypto venture capital firm and what the money will be used for the fund will help pay for investments ranging from non-fungible tokens to a partnership with the city of miami to use algorand in municipal municipal projects all in an effort to accelerate the development of algorand's ecosystem give me your thoughts on this i'm personally sort of neutral on algorand you cannot deny this is great news for algo and in a direct quote on his current stance on xrp because he used to be bullish and he still is bullish on the xrp ecosystem we are extremely loyal to ripple and xrp and we believe in that ecosystem but it's a multi-chain world so good news for algo holders let's keep going next up very quick piece of bitcoin news it's official elon musk will have no role in the bitcoin mining council and the story is sort of in the headline here as we know musk had a problem with bitcoin's energy consumption michael saylor introduced him to a lot of the prominent north american miners and after a secret talk i guess nothing really happened michael saylor is still a part of it though and you know what i like michael saylor better i'll say it and in his tweet he just describes what the bitcoin mining council is the bitcoin mining council is a voluntary and open forum of bitcoin miners committed to the network and its core principles we promote transparency share best practices and educate the public on the benefits of bitcoin and bitcoin mining i like it all right that's the video my name is austin like always see you tomorrow have a great weekend but i'll see you tomorrow short-term price doesn't matter we're talking about the greatest wealth transfer in history [Music] you
