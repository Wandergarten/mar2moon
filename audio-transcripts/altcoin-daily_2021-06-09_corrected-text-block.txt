all right welcome back everybody to altcoin daily the reason that you subscribe is because on a daily basis we break down everything going on in the cryptocurrency space we make it easy to understand we keep you informed in today's video i want to update you on theta and tfuel monero polkadot and kusama amazon and defi and of course ethereum bitcoin and maybe if we have time we'll get to some other cryptocurrencies in this space before we get to any of this however and make sure you check the timestamps below but before we get to any of this we need to take stock of the current state of the market because make no mistake about it in shorter time frames bitcoin ethereum the whole cryptocurrency market is in a bear trend we are in a bear trend on shorter time frames we are in a bold trend on longer time frames but recognize that currently we are in a bare trend so it's possible that we could get that one final capitulation we'll get to this in just a second but you're sensing this in the market at the moment am i right there is extreme fear on the bitcoin fear and greed index which is now at a 13 and for the past couple weeks it's been in the red this whole time and there's been a different thing every day today the fud is this u.s seized 2.3 million in bitcoin from colonial pipeline hackers in the worst way to interpret this news which we've seen plenty of mainstream media publications do is that the fbi was able to hack bitcoin and recover the ransomed bitcoin and that is just not true so the news that the fbi had recovered bitcoin sent fear in the markets with some believing that the service or that the fbi could hack the bitcoin network again not true so this is what happened the on-chain bitcoin addresses linked to the colonial pipeline ransom were not hacked once the fbi figured out the public key of the ransomed bitcoin by analyzing on-chain data it linked that public key to a certain custodian the custodian for that address was then asked to share that private key and as the popular crypto saying goes not your keys not your bitcoin so here's the thing guys the bitcoin network was not hacked the fbi merely was able to gain access to the criminals private keys and they were not in custody of their own crypto so that was fairly easy for the fbi if you protect and store your cryptocurrency properly and become your own bank and take that responsibility it is much much harder if not impossible for anybody to seize your bitcoin and this is one of the revolutions that is bitcoin and if you do want to do that i recommend ledger nano s or ledger nano x you can compare the two devices i'll leave the link in the description and the pinned comment below this is how you protect and store your cryptocurrency safely if you want to take on that responsibility of being your own bank but let's talk about the state of the bitcoin network very quickly and then we'll get into some ethereum and defi and altcoins and when we take a look at the network we we tend to see a few things are true number one long-term holders are continuing to accumulate this is trust this shows trust and strength in the network this is what we want to see so this is surely a good thing but let's not mince words like i said in the beginning it is possible we see something like this a final capitulation because you know where we are right now looks similar to bottom accumulation so it could be bottom accumulation or it could be this and this is basically what we saw in 2018 if you're you know a bear market og like myself many people thought that 6k was the bottom because it held so long but there was that final capitulation and then a bottom actually formed and you can see they look very similar and it's almost impossible to know where we are until after it already happens my personal belief and again i have no idea my personal belief is that this was the bottom and if it wasn't the bottom it's very close to the bottom and what we'll soon see is more of a v-shaped recovery similar to what we saw in 2017 but like i said bitcoin on longer term time frames still looks great to me bitcoins are being moved off exchanges at the highest rate since november in fact yesterday the most bitcoin was removed from exchanges in a single day this year 22 500 so people are buying the dip that is for sure and more and more people it is getting revealed are actually bitcoin or crypto holders check this out tim wu top official in joe biden's national economic council holds between 1 million and five million worth of bitcoin and over a hundred thousand worth of file coin this is according to his latest filed financials so probably something that he doesn't wouldn't necessarily want to admit but he has to make these financials public and now we know white house advisor holds over 1 million in bitcoin this is bullish and this is a gentleman who is famous for coining the term net neutrality and the details are this tim wu a member of the national economics council in the us holds bitcoin and filecoin check this out his financials reveal that his cryptocurrency investments account for more than 25 of his assets so he has a lot of money in crypto tim wu serves as special assistant to president biden on technology and competition policy pretty bullish this is what i'd like to see so we just went over the current state of the market and bitcoin let's move on to ethereum and some alt coins i'm curious to hear from you though in the comments let me know your thoughts on the current state of the market are you bearish are you bullish what are you doing over one percent of bitcoin now lives as wrapped bitcoin on ethereum there are now more than 187 000 wrapped bitcoin on ethereum representing over one percent of bitcoin's circulating supply one percent of the bitcoin circulating supply is actually a lot of bitcoin and we're continuing to see bitcoin and ethereum both grow and both complement each other so interesting development speaking about ethereum more than 5 million eth is being staked on the ethereum network that's around almost 5 of the circulating supply of eth is being staked on ethereum this is trust in ethe 2.0 and this is about 14 billion committed to the security of ethereum through staking i like that and speaking of validators for ether2 or on the beacon chain 160 validators are securing the beacon chain with 7 000 pending incredible vote of confidence in the future of ethereum so i'm bullish on bitcoin i'm bullish on ethereum check this out amazon job listing seeks defi

polkadot or kusama major protocol update it's on its way parachains auction on polkadots canary network kusama will begin from june 15th the project founder former ethereum founder a co-founder gavin wood wrote on tuesday so both polkadot and kusama are trying to create an interoperable network of 100 pair chains plugged in to a central relay chain as you know kusama is an identical network to polkadot except its role is to function as a test network and experiment with various tech features before they can be rolled out on polkadot and um this big milestone is coming to kusama and then polkadot and uh this is you know the main net launched over a year ago and they're finally getting to pair chains and this is what we've been reporting on and this is what we like to see monero team receives anonymous half a million donations so monero is a privacy coin with the best lindy effect monero is definitely still in the game monero has received a donation of 1 700 monero coins maybe from a monero whale maybe from a monero believer it's worth half a million so the monero team plans to publish a spending report in the coming months monero's general fund where this money was donated to helps the project purchase web services tools and salaries for contractors so monero i'm curious do you guys own monero anybody like have a total position for a monero i know some people that do finally let's talk about theta network theta and theta tfuel soar ahead of its june 30th mainnet launch now first of all what is data network it is a samsung and sony backed data network that wants to make it cheaper for companies to share video content so they're backed by some big names and some big money and basically theta network aims to provide a decentralized infrastructure for video streaming that's cheaper than centralized alternatives participants in the theta network are paid in tokens for sharing video content to the users their mainnet is about to launch on june 30th this project is years in the making towards the end of may price action for theta and tfuel began to ramp up after the project revealed that the creative artist agency caa one of the biggest talent agencies for actors and sports and musicians has become the newest validator node operator for the network so they're actually getting all these big names and all these companies to run validator nodes that's something interesting something to keep an eye on the subsequent release of one-click delegated staking for the theta web wallet also raised excitement in the community as the simplified method for earning a yield is ideal for hodlers who don't want to deal with more complicated ways of yield farming investors looking to stake on the network are required to hold a minimum of 1 000 theta tokens which are worth roughly 10 000 at current prices so main net launch june 30th what do you think about theta and tfuel i happen to own some i bought theta in tfuel way back in and i just held on and uh it's been working out quite nicely so far anyway guys that is the news of the day subscribe to the channel let me know what you think in the comments below interesting times
