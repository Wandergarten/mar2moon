all right welcome back everybody to alt coin daily where you subscribe for a video on cryptocurrency every day my name's austin this is the most important video on cryptocurrency you will watch today i repeat this is the most important video on cryptocurrency you will watch i want to share with you never before heard audio of the president of el salvador talking about what he has just done in his country this is history and by the way when i say nobody has heard this audio before i mean other than the 20 000 people around the world that were lucky enough to be awake late last night to watch this live i didn't think i could get more bullish about bitcoin but then i listened to the president of el salvador talking about making it legal tender in his country on twitter spaces in front of an audience of over 20 000 enraptured people around the world if you're unfamiliar with twitter spaces just understand it's very similar to clubhouse on iphone people can see it jump in choose to speak here is the news el salvador has just become the first country in the world to approve bitcoin as a legal currency and in fact looking at the exact vote from a tweet from the president last night the bitcoin law has been approved by a super majority in the salvadorian congress 62 out of 84 votes in favor this is history bullish now to explain exactly what this means for el salvador as well as for you as a bitcoin holder here's the clip which by the way was just supposed to be among friends among bitcoiners talking about what's happening in el salvador little did everybody know the president would hop in warning this will make you bullish watch this the president is just hello thank you for joining us mr president thank you yeah thank you for opening the space yeah we got like 10 000 people in here a lot of bitcoiners you know tons and tons of bitcoiners listening to you right now pass this bill i i just follow you thanks for the follow i just followed you back using bitcoin accepting bitcoin is going to be a mandate so it's not like if you go to a mcdonald's i mean probably most of you don't like mcdonald's but if you go to a mcdonald's or whatever um they cannot say we're not gonna take your bitcoin they have to take it by law because it's a legal tender just like any other currency any other any other part of the world so if you for example if you go to mexico you will you they have to take your pesos it's not like they they would say i'm not going to take your pesos you have to pay me with dollars they have to take the pesos because that's the legal tender in mexico so in the case of in the case of wasabi their bitcoin is going to be legal tender just as the u.s dollar it's only not it's only not going to going to apply for accounting that's the only part where the u.s dollar is going to remain as the exclusive it's an accounting so the balance sheet the company's balance sheets will be in the u.s dollars but that's it everything even taxes can be paid with bitcoin so it's it's going to be a full mandate and everybody every restaurant every barber shop every hotel every bank uh every personal transaction every if you want to sell a car everything can be paid in u.s dollars or in bitcoin and nobody can refuse the payment like other for example foreign currencies you can accept it but you're not you're not obligated to accept it for you can do a transaction in euros but you're not obligated to to do that transaction in euros because it's not a it's not a legal tender here it's just a foreign currency in case of in in the case of bitcoin it's going to be legal tender and it's going to be treated like a national currency so everybody has to accept it wow what a time to be alive share this like this get this information out to as many people as possible and by the way if i didn't mention it congress is voting on on this law as he was speaking to us on twitter it was so cool let me play you one last clip of the president talking about the domino effect this could have and what this means for bitcoiners around the world watch this i think bitcoin as being the main uh cryptocurrency in the world it's being soaps a lot of problems no uh oversupply it doesn't it's not in the hands you know there's a lot of inequality that comes from from the the central banking system because they they they put the money in but they choose where that new money goes to but but we wanted we want not only to support it but we want also to for to demonstrate that we can that the world can benefit from it and i think else is not only a country anymore it's it's a symbol of of what bitcoin can do and i'm sure this is going to be a lot of pouring in of new technology change our future and probably we will start seeing other countries follow so we're going to see a lot of futures a lot a lot of countries future changing and that's going to help build a better society so i think so the bill passes with super majority congratulations to you all all right so yeah fantastic we only needed 43 votes but it passed with a super majority which is good because i mean it's representative of the of the whole nation the whole nation is behind this okay give me your thoughts on this conversation down below like i said share the video get this information out there and by the way i'm gonna keep searching the minute i find other conversations like this i'm gonna share with you now next piece of news we kind of have china going in the opposite direction here we'll get to that but first i want to update you on the latest altcoins making news starting with litecoin two game changers coming to litecoin says creator charlie lee so if you hold ltc listen up in an interview with crypto analyst scott melker lee highlights why litecoin's upcoming update will add more fungibility and privacy to the digital token which is crucial to sound money principles and of course when he says fungibility by fungibility lee means that every coin is the same as every other coin fungibility allows users to interchange goods or assets with another good or asset of the same type just because they are identical and have equal value and you may be saying austin one bitcoin equals any other bitcoin one litecoin equals any other litecoin i thought those cryptocurrencies were fungible and the answer is yes they are but they're not one hundred percent fungible for example if you got paid ten thousand dollars as a salary and then you use some of that money you use some of those coins to buy a coffee then the recipient will see that you have ten thousand dollars in your bank account worth of bitcoin that's the kind of information that you want to keep private even if you have nothing to hide financial privacy is important yes i agree so what is this update that charlie lee is talking about what i'm working on is getting a technology called mimblewimble onto litecoin as an extension block the project's called mweb which stands for mimble wimble extension blocks that would add more privacy and more fungibility to litecoin and i think that's going to help it become a better form of money so if you hold litecoin expect this update in the near near future we'll see charlie lee did talk about this last year it's nice to have an update as this is something to expect i'll keep you updated and that brings us to our china news both weibo zihu hope i'm pronouncing that right and they do are censoring crypto exchanges in china and for clarity baidu and weibo are major internet services in china so china is trying to discourage its people from buying cryptocurrency in the most sneaky ways possible and this is just like google on amazon and somebody else got together here in the states and censored all their platforms where you wouldn't be able to see these cryptocurrency exchanges weibo zehu and three major internet services in china appear to be actively censoring huobi binance and okex three of the most commonly used crypto exchanges for chinese investors and consumers well how are they censoring these exchanges searching for the exchanges or any relevant keywords has generated zero results for users on these three platforms and the lack of results has been noticed on both platforms desktop and mobile apps and what do we know what do we know about china china is very bullish on their own cryptocurrency their own cbd stablecoin which is why they're being very rigorous in the banning in the discouraging of bitcoin and ethereum they want to keep people away from the decentralized cryptocurrencies and have more interest go to their own stablecoin but it is sneaky because other terms like bitcoin like ethereum are not censored it's just the exchanges where you could buy those cryptocurrencies that is the video my name is austin like always see you tomorrow have a great day great great day
