Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,00:40:41.200,00:40:53.920,ETH,contradictory opinions and that's totally fine and amazing some people describe mev minor extractable value as an existential risk to ethereum what is mev how important is it to solve,ETH,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,00:41:10.800,00:41:21.119,crypto_space,of brett first so uh basically okay ebbyv minor extractable value um it is not different in proof of work and proof of stake right so like if you want,,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,00:47:31.200,00:47:40.240,ETH,at the same time a lot of things are done off-chain and so you get more scalability that way um so in ethereum the most popular paradigm failure too is,ETH,

Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:15:36.719,01:15:46.880,ETH,takes a bit more work but that's being done as well right so like within a few months i'm expecting you know fully ethereum um capable um roll ups to,ETH,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:19:18.640,01:19:31.600,ETH,call them yeah it's brilliant summary of the work actually uh ethereum documentation period is really good i think that's somewhat crowdsourced that documentation is really really accessible and brilliant,ETH,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:21:45.440,01:21:52.880,ETH,did not do that right if you think about an ethereum ecosystem hypothetically scaling with side chains then you know you would have 100 copies of polygon and you know,ETH,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:24:55.120,01:25:05.040,ETH,i think the compromise that we've been taking within ethereum is like when we have to take the crappy solution we look for crappy solutions that are forward compatible with,ETH,

Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:46:46.639,01:46:56.400,ETH,the start as a general purpose blockchain right it's you know there is ether the asset on ethereum but then you can also make you know decentralized financial things what,ETH,

Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:51:47.440,01:51:55.440,DOGE,there was cat coin there was neon coin for some reason they just didn't catch on as much as the dog coins did okay so let's talk about dogecoin and,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:51:55.440,01:52:14.880,DOGE,elon musk elon said that quote ideally doge speeds up block time 10x increases block size 10x and drops fee 100x then it wins hands down end quote you said,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:52:14.880,01:52:30.320,DOGE,in the blog post partially responding to that that there are subtle technical reasons why this is not possible to this elon said that you quote fear the doge uh,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:52:30.320,01:52:39.760,DOGE,so let's talk about this what are the technical uh hurdles for dogecoin that prevent it from becoming one of the primary cryptocurrencies of the world and do you in,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:52:39.760,01:52:48.480,DOGE,fact fear the doge i definitely feel obligated to correct the record i definitely do not fear the dosh okay no i love the dosh um i actually visited the,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:52:48.480,01:53:01.440,DOGE,doge in japan a few years back it's uh she's an amazing dog he's still alive wait the original doge yeah oh wow um so you know we accept doge,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:53:17.840,01:53:27.520,DOGE,i love doge i bought i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold some a bunch of dosh the on the scalability question like the challenge basically is like,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:53:46.639,01:53:55.679,DOGE,like some of the layer two technologies that we've been talking about um i mean i personally think that you know if doge wants to somehow bridge to ethereum and,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:53:55.679,01:54:03.920,DOGE,then people can trade doge thousands of times a second inside of loopering then you know that would be amazing i mean if they want to just like take zika,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:54:11.679,01:54:25.520,DOGE,what is there ways for ethereum and uh dogecoin to work together so okay so there's a power behind a person like elon musk pushing the development of a cryptocurrency,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:54:25.520,01:54:39.119,ETH,is there ways to leverage that power and that momentum to improve ethereum to improve some of the sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are already technologically advanced and pushing forward,ETH,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:54:39.119,01:54:50.400,DOGE,that kind of technology i i definitely think there is room for you know that uh there's that meme of doge like taking over that's the door i've seen it,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:54:50.400,01:55:00.880,DOGE,is there a way to ride that uh that storm that wave of the doge has taken over i think if we could have a secure doshu ethereum bridge then,DOGE,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:55:00.880,01:55:10.000,ETH,you know that would be amazing and then when ethereum gets its scalability any scalability thing that works for ethereum assets you would be able to also like trade wrapped,ETH,
Lex_Fridman_20210603_Vitalik_Buterin_-_Ethereum_2.0___Lex_Fridman_Podcast_#188.en.vtt,01:55:47.840,01:56:00.239,DOGE,um but um you know if there's potentially some way for dogecoin to merge mine within ethereum proof of stake ins of some kinds then like that could be an,DOGE,
