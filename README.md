Goal: Cryptocurrency price forecasting using audio-based sentiment analysis

Idea: 
The past year has seen plenty big changes and trends (of quarantine-ing): 
1. Financial market turbulences hitting and lifting asset prices to historical lows and all-time-highs. A group of financial assets that has profited most of the unexpected volatility was the cryptocurrency sphere. Most importantly Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). Another trend in investment was the emergence of meme stocks, e.g. AMC, GameStop (GAME), and (positively said) "influencer investment", i.e. Elon twittering about cryptocurrencies. 
All of those trends could not be foreseen adequately by funds using automated, social media-based sentiment analysis (e.g. BUZZ ETF, Vaneck Social Sentiment ETF). We believe this is due to them using a wrong data base: social media data is just too noisy and unreliable. 
2. Podcasts are (still) up and coming. Since podcasting has low (technological) entry barriers, there has been a surge in podcasts available. While podcasts usually are entirely free to use (for consumers), the competition for user's attention has increased significantly. Result is that higher quality content is easily identifiable (in podcast charts). 


All of these factors make podcasts a great source for sentiment analysis: 
Podcasts are freely available on the internet, they have huge quality advantages over regular social media-based data, and offer a whole new technological challenge to tackle!
